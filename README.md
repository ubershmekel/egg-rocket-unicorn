# Ideas for Ludum Dare 46

The theme is "Keep it alive".

# Keep it alive ideas

* A patient that's dying, and you have to constantly treat different parts
* Turn based bullet hell. A person walking through a simple maze, but every step can mean death from a trap, bullet, etc.

I would like to constrain myself:

* Simplest code and engine possible, to make it easy to learn from.
* My kids, aged 7 and under, can play
* Preferably with characters they like: rocket, robot, unicorn, puppy
* Health and Corona virus are going to be cliche themes I'd rather avoid
* Would be nice if they would learn some math or reading while playing.
