# Ideas for Ludum Dare 46

The theme is "Keep it alive".

# Keep it alive ideas

- A patient that's dying, and you have to constantly treat different parts
- Turn based bullet hell. A person walking through a simple maze, but every step can mean death from a trap, bullet, etc.

I would like to constrain myself:

- Simplest code and engine possible, to make it easy to learn from.
- My kids, aged 7 and under, can play
- Preferably with characters they like: rocket, robot, unicorn, puppy
- Health and coronavirus are going to be cliche themes I'd rather avoid
- Would be nice if they would learn some math or reading while playing.
- Tablet play friendly

So better ideas would be:

- Move center, left or right, avoiding falling numbers. E.g. you are "17", you must dodge "9+9" and catch "9+8".
- I love clicker economy games, maybe you're running a business that is going bankrupt and need to buy/sell things to keep the business alive.
- I love runner games, maybe you're a blind puppy running, and a unicorn makes rainbows to keep saving you from death.

What are we keeping alive?

A business, a character, a human, a niche competitive scene, a band, words, a color?

- A game where you need to create a specific color, by removing colors from the many in view.

The word "it" is something we want to keep alive.

- Maybe your phone is running out of battery and you have to keep finding charge spots?
- Protect a torch from the wind
- A marriage, you try to keep it working, but you're making a game during your wife's birthday.
- Draw a heart monitor pulse to keep the patient alive.
- Keep the beat alive as a drummer

Level 1 = find the 1
Level 2 = find the 1+1
Level 3 = find the 2+1
Level 4 = find the 2+2, 2+1
Level 5 = find the 2+3, 4+1
Level 6 = find the 5+1, 4+2, 3+3

But what does math have anything to do with keeping something alive....

Maybe a grid, you're a unicorn with a number goal

1 2 3 4 5
4 3 2 1 5
7 6 5 5 3
9 8 5 3 2
7 3 5 u 2
